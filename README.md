This project was designed to automate product search and price extraction from eMAG, leveraging Selenium WebDriver and Cucumber for test automation. 
I implemented data scraping to extract product names, prices, and customer reviews, storing them in CSV and JSON formats.
Additionally, I automated the test execution using CI/CD pipelines in Jenkins and GitHub Actions, ensuring efficient and scheduled runs.
